# Task 12: Creating a CSV File

A teacher is writing a program to automate some SQA processes for their school.  

They want a program that will allow them to enter Forenames, Surnames and Scottish Candidate Numbers (SCNâ€™s).  

 

The program should then export the data into a Comma Separated File which could be used to import into a database.
