# Task 9: Converting Numbers

Your task is to create a function to check if a number that has been entered is an integer or not. 

** Example:**

Please enter a number to test: 5.0 
The number is an Integer 

  

Please enter a number to test: 5.1 
The number is a real number. 

  

**Extension**

Adapt your function to return a single parameter but be able to use this to state if a number is positive or negative and use this to implement a program similar to below: 

Please enter a number to test: 5.0 
The number is a positive Integer 

  

Please enter a number to test: -5.1 
The number is a negative real number.
